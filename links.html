    <h1 id="top">Creating Links In HTMl</h1>
    <p>
        A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another.
        Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any server anywhere in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        A link has two ends, called anchors.
        The link starts at the source anchor and points to the destination anchor, which may be any web resource, for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.

     <h3 id="mysql">My SQL</h3>
     <p>
        Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Twitter, Booking.com, and Verizon rely on 
        MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software.

     </p>
     <p>
        MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. 
        MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).
        [8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]
     </p>
    <p>
        MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL,
         but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability
    </p>


    <h3 id="or">Oracle</h3>
    <p>
        Oracle is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company was formerly headquartered in Redwood Shores, California, until December 2020 when it moved its headquarters to Texas.
        [7] The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software products
    </p>
<p>
    The company also develops and builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software,
    Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, Human Capital Management (HCM) software, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (AKA customer experience), Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) software, and Supply Chain Management (SCM) software.[9]
</p>
<p>
    In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation,[15] officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.[16] Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems most of which support C.[17]
    In 2005 Oracle acquired PeopleSoft, an ERP company, and in 2006 Siebel, a CRM company. In 2008 Oracle acquired BEA Systems an enterprise infrastructure software company and in 2010 Sun Microsystems, an Information Technology company.

<h3 id="mongo">Mongo db</h3>
<p>
    MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 
    MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).
</p>
<p>
    On October 30, 2019, MongoDB teamed up with Alibaba Cloud, who will offer its customers a MongoDB-as-a-service solution.
    Customers can use the managed offering from BABA's global data centers.[7]
</p>
<p>
    MongoDB supports field, range query, and regular-expression searches.[28] Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions.
    Queries can also be configured to return a random sample of results of a given size.
